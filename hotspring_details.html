                <p>"Watching Old Faithful Geyser erupt is a Yellowstone National Park tradition. People from all over
                    the
                    world have journeyed here to watch this famous geyser. The park’s wildlife and scenery might be as
                    well-known today, but it was the unique thermal features like Old Faithful Geyser that inspired the
                    establishment of Yellowstone as the world’s first national park in 1872.
                    Old Faithful is one of nearly 500 geysers in Yellowstone and one of six that park rangers currently
                    predict. It is uncommon to be able to predict geyser eruptions with regularity and Old Faithful has
                    lived up to its name, only lengthening the time between eruptions by about 30 minutes in the last 30
                    years.
                    Thermal features change constantly and it is possible Old Faithful may stop erupting someday.
                    Geysers
                    and other thermal features are evidence of ongoing volcanic activity beneath the surface and change
                    is
                    part of this natural system. Yellowstone preserves the natural geologic processes so that visitors
                    may
                    continue to enjoy this natural system.
                    Watch eruptions from the Old Faithful viewing area or along the boardwalks that weave around the
                    geyser
                    and through the Upper Geyser Basin."
